# Hedgehog-SFML-simpleGame
 A very simple game in C ++ SFML where you need to move a hedgehog along a horizontal plane using the keys (W, A, S, D or Left, Right etc.) on the keyboard and catch falling leaves. 
 The player gets a different number of points depending on the type of object caught. For each missed object, the player loses a "reserve of lives". After 1000 points, the speed of falling objects accelerates. 
 The game has a "Game over" and "Pause" function (press the P key).

The project is suitable for beginners, it has a minimum of OOP, and the code uses the most basic features of the C++ language and the SFML library.

To build the game, you will need to connect the SFML library 2.6.0. You can do this by looking at the manual on the official website: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/
Or if you use Visual Studio, use the easiest way to install SFML via NuGet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on7U-90gfrI (SFML-audio is installed separately!)
